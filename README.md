1 For the implementation of the project I have used HTML file structures the webpage, the CSS file for styling and the JavaScript file adds dynamic behavior. 
2 I have created an array of chocolate options in JavaScript, each with an ID, name, and price. The program dynamically generates the chocolate options on the webpage based on this array. 
3 As users input quantities for each chocolate, event listeners trigger updates to the selected chocolates and the total price, providing a real-time feedback mechanism. The layout is designed to be responsive, adapting to different screen sizes. This approach ensures a straightforward, organized, and user-friendly implementation of the custom chocolate bundle feature.
